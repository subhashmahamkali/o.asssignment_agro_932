This repository is for my assignment adn project for AGro_932 Biometrical genetics and plant breeding at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. taught by Dr.Jinliang Yang.

For this assignments we will do balancing selection and other population genetic analysis.
I have clearly written a .Rmd file for each assignment starting from data download and analysis and tools that we are going to use.
